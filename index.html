          <p>
              The U.S. has almost 500 students for every guidance counselor. Underserved youth lack the network to 
              find their career role models, making CareerVillage.org the only option for millions of young people 
              in America and around the globe with nowhere else to turn.
              To date, 25,000 volunteers have created profiles and opted in to receive emails when a career question 
              is a good fit for them. This is where your skills come in. To help students get the advice they need, 
              the team at CareerVillage.org needs to be able to send the right questions to the right volunteers. 
              The notifications sent to volunteers seem to have the greatest impact on how many questions are answered.<br>
               <strong>objective: develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who 
                 are most likely to answer them.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>
              Data Overview
          </h2>

          <p>
              Below you can find the diagram with data and relations.
              Essential primary entities are "Professional", "Student", "Question" and "Answer".
              The most useful secondary entity is "Tag."
              
              Primary and secondary entities are used to create so-called "content" features.
              Other data is divided into two main parts "activity" and "time" features.

          <h3>CSV Files</h3>
    
          <p>

          For our initial model, we will keep things simple and focus on the datasets that appear to be revelant 
          for our recommender system.

          Information on the users. Users consist of professionals & students<br>
          <strong>professionals.csv:</strong> We call our volunteers "Professionals", but we might as 
          well call them Superheroes. They're the grown ups who volunteer their time to answer questions on the site.<br>
          <strong>students.csv:</strong> Students are the most important people on CareerVillage.org. 
          They tend to range in age from about 14 to 24. They're all over the world, and they're the reason we exist!<br>
          <strong>tag_users.csv:</strong> Users of any type can follow a hashtag. This shows you which 
          hashtags each user follows.<br>
          
          The Q&A information:<br>

          <strong>questions.csv:</strong> Questions get posted by students. Sometimes they're very advanced. 
          Sometimes they're just getting started. It's all fair game, as long as it's relevant to the student's 
          future professional success.<br>

        <strong>tag_questions.csv:</strong> Every question can be hashtagged. We track the hashtag-to-question 
        pairings, and put them into this file.<br>

      <strong>answers.csv:</strong> Answers are what this is all about! Answers get posted in response
       to questions. Answers can only be posted by users who are registered as Professionals. However,
        if someone has changed their registration type after joining, they may show up as the author of an
         Answer even if they are no longer a Professional.<br>

        Information on the platform:<br> 

      <strong>emails.csv:</strong> Each email corresponds to one specific email to one specific recipient. 
      The frequency_level refers to the type of email template which includes immediate emails sent right after a 
      question is asked, daily digests, and weekly digests.<br>

    <strong>matches.csv:</strong> Each row tells you which questions were included in emails. If an email contains 
    only one question, that email's ID will show up here only once. If an email contains 10 questions, that email's 
    ID would show up here 10 times.<br>

  <strong>tags.csv:</strong> Each tag gets a name.<br>

        Other tables:<br>

      <strong>group_memberships.csv:</strong> Any type of user can join any group. There are only a handful of 
      groups so far.<br>
      <strong>group.csv:</strong>  Each group has a "type"<br>
    <strong>school_memberships.csv:</strong> Just like group_memberships, but for schools instead.<br>
  <strong>comments.csv:</strong> Comments can be made on Answers or Questions. We refer to whichever the comment
   is posted to as the "parent" of that comment. Comments can be posted by any type of user. Our favorite comments
    tend to have "Thank you" in them :)<br>
<strong>question_scores.csv:</strong> "Hearts" scores for each question.<br>
 <strong>answer_scores.csv:</strong> "Hearts" scores for each answer.<br>

              <li>Method for taking into account all the possible content features using custom Neural Network 
              Architecture. Allows automatically find a probability mapping between question and professional 
              entities in all of the combinations (que-que, que-pro, pro-que, pro-pro). It is trained in a way that 
              even without any information about professional and his activity, it still recommends questions, and
               breaks cold start problem having its own internal scoring.</li>
              <li> Method *activity_filter* for filtering out all the inactive professionals in order 
                to send immediate emails to professionals who are most likely answer the question, and answer it fast</li>
              <li> Methods *spam_filter* and *email_filter* for sending emails which allows to handle spam 
                problem and controls frequency and amount of emails for each professional based on his personal 
                emails reaction type and speed (here reaction==answer)</li>
              <li> The method which tries to activate inactive and "cold" professionals by breaking *activity_filter* 
                and *email_filter* with some probability. This is needed for making an attempt to activate the user or 
                remind him about relevant questions which were already sent to him.</li>

      <h3>Interpretation</h3>

      <p>
          In this pie chart I am trying to show the activity of professionals in terms of number of posted answers.
          As it can be seen easily in the figure above most of the professionals (63.9%) still haven't posted their 
          first answer. Also 15.2% of professionals have answered only one question. So we need to come up with an idea
          to increase the activity rate of professionals.
          *           
          A good recommendation system can surely help professionals find relevant questions to 
          answer and increase their activity on the platform.
      </p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>
          This pie chart shows clearly that there is a need to increase the number of active professionals.

        <img src="pictures/Professional_activity_Barchart.png" alt="Professional_activity_Barchart" height="700" width="700">
        <h3>Interpretation</h3>
  
        <p>
          This visualization shows the number of active (posted at least one answer) and inactive 
          (didn't post any answer) professionals each year. comparing the number of active and incative professionals
          shows that the ratio of active to inactive professionals have decreased over time.So again this proves that 
          a recommender system is needed to encourage inactive professional to contribute.
